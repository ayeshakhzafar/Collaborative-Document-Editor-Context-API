# Created a Document Context to manage:
- The content of the document.
- A list of active collaborators (e.g., users currently editing the document).

# Features:
- Real-time typing simulation (mock this for now by showing "User X is typing..." when interacting with the input field).
- Undo/Redo functionality using a state history array.
